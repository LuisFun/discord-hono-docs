## Current Direction

We will support as much as possible of the following.

- Run on Cloudflare Workers
- Covering Interactions with Discord

The following items are not basically supported.  
However, if sponsorship is obtained, it is likely to be addressed.

- Runs on non-Cloudflare environments
- API Endpoint Requests and Responses

This is a restriction we have added because we do development as a hobby.
