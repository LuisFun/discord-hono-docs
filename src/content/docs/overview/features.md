## Current Direction

We will support as much as possible of the following.

- Run on Cloudflare Workers
- Covering Interactions with Discord

The following items are not basically supported.  
However, if sponsorship is obtained, it is likely to be addressed.

- Runs on non-Cloudflare environments
- All API Endpoints Requests and Responses

I decided not to support everything because the maintenance cost would be too high for something Iâ€™m developing as a hobby.
